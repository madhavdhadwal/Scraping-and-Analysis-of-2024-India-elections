Hello !

Welcome to my project. I have scraped the information of the recently concluded 2024 Indian elections from the official government website of election commission of India. 
I have used "scrapy" for web scraping because it is most appropriate open-source web-crawling framework for handling complex projects with multiple web pages. Also, scrapy can scrape 
the data at a much faster speed than other frameworks or packages like beautiful soup.

Also, I have used Power BI software to analyze the data by visualizing it.

To review the project follow these steps :

Please click on "Lok_Sabha_elections_2024" 
You will see a list of files in this folder.

In the "Data Visualization" folder, you will see the Power BI source file "Data Visualizations.pbix" along with the exported PDF of the file. 
Please note that in order to properly run the Power BI source file, you would need to download the source file and open it using "Power BI Desktop" in your system.

The "Lok_Sabha_elections_2024" folder contains the scrapy source code. It contains all the components of the scrapy i.e Spiders, Pipelines, Middlewares, Engine and Scheduler.
Click on "spiders" to view all the spiders which I created for web crawling. Every spider web crawls a certain web page. You will find the python code for all the spiders in that folder.

Go to the "Scraped data" folder to find the scraped data in the form of different csv datasets.

Click on "Report on 2024 Lok Sabha elections.docx" -> "view raw" to view the insights generated from data visualization.

I have also made a short screen recording video for data visualization. Please find it at the link below :
